# 1.1 Introduction to ReactJS
ReactJs is frontend JavaScript libray developed by the Facebook for creating the inter- active UIs.ReactJs is not a framework unlike AngularJs.ReactJs can be used as base for development of single web page based application or mobile applications.React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

React Js is widely being used in popular websites like facebook,instagram(web version),Airbnb,Tesla,Netflix and manymore


### Why to use ReactJS?

### Problem:
In traditional web application programming, for even a small change in the webpage, the entire web page needs to be reloaded. This makes the web pages very slower.

### How ReactJS solves this problem?: 
React only updates what’s necessary(necessary components that is to be rendered not an entire webpage).Moreover, React allows developers to create large web applications with complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components” which can change data, without reloading the entire webpage making it faster solving the above stated problem.

## React Developer Tools
Please download [React DevTools for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) as this extension will help you a lot while working with React.

After you install it, when you open DevTools in chrome, you’ll see a tab for React. Click on it,and you’ll be able to inspect components of paticular website(app created using React JS) as in figure below.However, You can still go to the Elements tab to see the actual DOM output. But,it may not seem like that much of a deal for smaller application.As the app gets more complicated, it will become increasingly necessary to use.

Press Ctrl+shift+i And Then inside the component there will be list of all component used in the application along with the details of component.
